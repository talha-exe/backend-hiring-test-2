# Backend Technical Task - Banking API (Intermediate)

This test is a part of our hiring process at TuringTech for backend positions. It should take you between 3 and 4 hours depending on your experience. Hope you will have as much fun as we did coding this test!

## Objective

Your assignment is to build an internal API for a fake financial institution using NodeJS.

### Brief

While modern banks have evolved to serve a plethora of functions, at their core, banks must provide certain basic features. Your task is to build the basic HTTP API for one of those banks! Imagine you are designing a backend API for bank employees. It could ultimately be consumed by multiple frontends (web, iOS, Android etc).

### Tasks

- Implement assignment using Nodejs or any other Node specific framework:
- There should be API routes that allow them to:
- Create a new bank account for a customer, with an initial deposit amount. A single customer may have multiple bank accounts.
- Transfer amounts between any two accounts, including those owned by different customers.
- Retrieve balances for a given account.
- Retrieve transfer history for a given account.
- Write tests for your business logic

Feel free to pre-populate your customers with the following:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Arisha Barron"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Branden Gibson"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Rhonda Church"
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Georgina Hazel"
  }
]
You are expected to design any other required models and routes for your API.

## Evaluation Criteria

- NodeÂ best practices
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: is the system adequately tested?
- Documentation: is the API well-documented?

## Bonus

- Use typescript
- Use NestJS or any other framework like loopback

# How to run the code
 - Make sure you have node Installed
 - run the command 'npm i'
 - run the command 'npm start' to start the project at port 3010
 - Use the provided Postman Collection for testing
 - That's All Folks! :)
